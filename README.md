### Maps

**Note**: This module does not include maps that are present in the PDF. It's expected that you use PDF2Foundry to import the PDFs to get the original maps. This module bundles all remaining maps that come up in various encounters but don't have a map which are a ton.

PS: I'm a developer first and foremost and my art skills are pretty bad ;)
